          <h1>Internet, Society and Design Justice</h1>

          <p>
          In Sasha Costanza-Chock’s article Traveling While Trans they talk about design justice. 
          They explain a personal experience which was one of many experiences where Sasha has been 
          subject to discomfort/discrimination by the hands of inequal design. Design justice refers 
          to design that follows a few core principles in order to overcome “how larger systems—including 
          norms, values, and assumptions—are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical 
          systems” (Costanza-Chock, 2020). These principles (explained by the Design Justice Network) guide 
          designers towards design that:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Helps communities in their struggle against exploitative/oppressive systems.</li>
              <li>Focuses on the voices of the oppressed.</li>
              <li>Prioritizes the community</li>
              <li>Views change as something that comes from the design process instead of something that 
                  emerges as a product of a process.</li>
              <li>Sees everyone as an expert with regard to their own lived experiences (which gives everyone 
                  a unique contribution that they bring to the design process).</li>
              <li>Is open and shares processes and tools with the community.</li>
              <li>Works towards an outcome that is sustainable and is controlled by the community.</li>
              <li>Is non-exploitative.</li>
              <li>Looks at what is already working (traditional practices/knowledge) before looking at new 
                  design options.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          (Design Justice Network, 2016)
          </p>
          <p>
          Thus, the issues revolving around design justice has to do with threats to the community, 
          tradition, equality and oppressive systems that come from design processes and outcomes that 
          do not follow the design justice framework.

          With regard to internet and society I shall look at Spyros Kasapis’ article, Internet Access is a 
          Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic. The article starts off strong stating that 
          happiness is a basic human right and everything that contributes to this is a basic human right as 
          well. Spyros goes on to explain that a few international organizations also see internet access as 
          a basic human right. However, in January of 2020 the Indian supreme court has declared it a 
          fundamental human right to have access to the internet in the digital age we live in 
          (Kasapis, 2020, p. 2). 
          </p>
          <p>
          Spyros states that the pandemic has brought to light the inequalities within capitalist societies 
          with regard to internet access. Social distancing and the minimisation of human contact 
          (in order to stop the spread of disease) has increased the need for internet access. Which excluded 
          people without internet access from taking part in the “new economy”. Meaning that they cannot buy 
          goods or work (Kasapis, 2020, p. 2).
          </p>
          <p>
          Startling amounts of people across the globe do not have access to the internet, which excludes 
          them from online education, information, and the labour market (Kasapis, 2020). Spyros concludes 
          the article by explaining  the questions which highlights the issues surrounding internet and 
          society:
          </p>
          <p>
          “Should all citizens have access to the internet - regardless of income - and if so, are governments 
          supposed to take care of it? The second question is purely political. What should be the rules 
          governing the internet and who will set them? To this question, we want to provide some answers.” 
          (Kasapis, 2020, p. 2).
          </p>
          <p>
          In conclusion I agree with both of the people I have spoken about above. I agree that design should 
          follow the principles from the Design Justice Network in order to overcome design issues resulting 
          in oppression, exploitation, or unhappiness. I also agree with Spyros with regards to the importance 
          of looking at the impact internet access has on society so that we can make a decision that could 
          improve the quality of life of many people around the world.
