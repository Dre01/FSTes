          <h1>Indirect Flights - Analysis</h1>

          <p>
          For this analysis I have chosen the net/web artwork, Indirect Flights 2015 by Joe Hamilton 
          and J.G. Biberkopf (sound). This artwork is supported by The Moving Museum and consists of 
          various layered images of raw materials, satellite imagery, natural textures, brush strokes, 
          and architectural fragments. All of these images are put together to create a panorama that 
          extends in all directions. You pan around by clicking and dragging the screen, when you do this 
          the layers move at different speeds which gives the illusion of depth while constantly changing 
          what is in view and what is hidden (Hamilton, 2015). Joe Hamilton says that this work is an 
          attempt to represent a contemporary landscape, in a moment defined by the vast number of digital 
          technologies and the global transportation of bodies, commodities and goods (Hamilton, 2015).

          In Danae’s article, Net Art, Post-internet Art, New Aesthetics: The Fundamentals of Art on the 
          Internet, they explain that the term “new aesthetics” refers to the merging of the digital and 
          the physical as a result of the internet and digital technology. Danae goes on the state that 
          James Bridle (an academic that focuses on computer science and AI) wanted to bring attention to 
          how artworks came to be, and how they will change (Danae, 2019: p 7) (along with the change of the 
          internet and digital technologies I assume). With this in mind Danae explains that “Mostly, New 
          Aesthetics reviews the network itself, its rhizomatic structure, and modes of functioning — a 
          technological apparatus that will become increasingly important to apprehend the arts.” 
          (Danae, 2019: pp 7-8). This final remark was a bit unclear to me: I am unsure whether Danae 
          is referring to the network, structure, and modes of functioning of specific artworks that are 
          being reviewed or whether Danae is referring to something else. I am going to assume that the 
          former is correct, and with that in mind when I look at Indirect Flights I, personally, cannot 
          think of anything particularly important to discuss about this artwork. In other words, using this 
          framework discussed by Danae I fail to see anything of value that I can say about the artwork that 
          the artist himself did not already say.

          That being said, I do see the value of this framework when looking at the internet culture 
          (and everything surrounding this) and how it is ever changing alongside technology. I agree 
          that “new aesthetics” would be a useful way to view/review the internet, internet culture, and 
          web/net art as a whole in order to understand how it all works together and how this affects 
          how people make and interact with art online.

          In David Carrier’s piece, The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet, he talks quite a bit about 
          how the internet created the opportunity for artists to showcase their work in online galleries 
          and how this is affecting physical galleries. He explains that in the art world everything is 
          becoming more and more focused on the digital and the internet (Carrier, 2020). When looking at 
          Indirect Flights I cannot help but to agree with Carrier because when interacting with this 
          particular artwork you get an experience that would be virtually impossible to recreate in the 
          physical. Carrier’s piece concludes with him explaining that Immanuel Kant’s Critique of the 
          Power of Judgment defined the aesthetic experience in terms of the agreeable, the beautiful, the 
          sublime, and the good. He goes on to point out that today in the age of the internet we lack a 
          similar philosophy when it comes to art online. He thus suggests a similar categorical system 
          which could be divided into the immediate, the social, the activist, and the “liked” 
          (Carrier, 2020: p 6). I understand that this refers to how the internet and online cultures have 
          changed how people view and value art, however I don’t see how to link this specific point to 
          Indirect Flights. Carrier talks a lot about how the internet has changed the original of an 
          artwork to somewhat of a collector’s item while the reproductions of the artwork become the 
          publics main focus (Carrier, 2020: pp 4-5). I agree with this point and it reminded me that the 
          internet has made it possible for artists to create amazing abstract works that would have been 
          impossible without the internet and digital technologies (such as Indirect Flights).
          </p>
          <p>
          In sum, I agree with both Carrier and Danae to some extent, but I fail to see the value that 
          these readings could add to Indirect Flights apart from that which the artist has already said 
          about his own work.
