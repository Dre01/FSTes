          Throughout this block I believe that I have progressed practically. I have learned how to work with react 
          as well as node. React was a very new experience, and it took me a while to get used to. As soon as 
          I got used to props, components, and states (I am very much still learning though) I started picking up speed 
          with the design of my website. Theoretically I feel like I have engaged with our work acceptably, that being said I 
          feel like I could have done more wuth regards to our theory this block. With the lack of class and discussion 
          I have not been very motivated to spend alot of time on theory which I am embarrassed to admit. Overall I think 
          my perfromance this block was acceptable and I am happy with this first assignment.
